description: Route detection and map-based blog indexing.

---

Writing a travel blog is hard enough, but it's incredibly frustrating to find that your hard work is almost impossible to navigate.  New readers are cast into a sea of posts.

To make it easier to get a sense of how all the posts tie together, I wrote a tool which automatically infers the route taken (using GPS data embedded in the images) and produces a hierarchical clustering of locations.  Now readers can zoom in and out of the locales they're interested in and find the relevant posts.  The route is also shown so it's easy to tell which places were visited in what order.

The page is [here][sea-trip].  The blog post explaining the technical details is [here][github-map].
