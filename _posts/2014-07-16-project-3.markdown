description: Comparison of expenses across countries.
---

What sort of a budget do you need to travel?  It's easy set a budget, but harder to stick to it.

After my travels in Southeast Asia, I sifted the data to find out much it actually cost. This project analyzed and visualized the expenses across the various countries I visited.

The visualization is [here][cost-viz-app].  It's written in Javascript with d3.js providing the charting.

If you care for the technical details they're described in a post on my blog [here][github-expenses]
